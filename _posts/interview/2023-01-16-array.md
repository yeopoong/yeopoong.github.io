## Array
> - 순서가 중요한 경우는 스택 또는 큐를 이용한다.
> - 스택에 어떤값을 넣을지는 결과값에 따라서 달라진다.

Prefix Sum

배열의 길이(Length) : right - left + 1

배열의 중앙값은 배열의 개수가 짝수 또는 홀수 일 경우로 나누어서 처리한다.

## Permutation
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

## Sort
```java
Arrays.sort(result, new Comparator<String>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
        return s1.compareTo(s2);
    }
});

Arrays.sort(result, (s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2));

Arrays.sort(costs, (a, b) -> {
    return (a[0] - a[1]) - (b[0] - b[1]);
});

Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
```
