## Graph

Vertext
Edge

Undirected Graph
Weighted Graph
Cyclic Graph
DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)

```java
// 연결 정보를 만든다.
// EX> n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
List<Integer>[] adjList = new ArrayList[n];
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    adjList[i] = new ArrayList<Integer>();
}

for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
    adjList[edges[i][0]].add(edges[i][1]);
    adjList[edges[i][1]].add(edges[i][0]);
}

```
