- 문자비교는 맵(문자배열)을 사용해서 체크

문자열에서 숫자 정보 추출하기
```java
digits.charAt(index) - '0'
```

문자열 스왑
```java
public void swap(char[] s, int left, int right) {
    char temp = s[left];
    s[left] = s[right];
    s[right] = temp; 
}
```

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Subsequence
> A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
  For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
