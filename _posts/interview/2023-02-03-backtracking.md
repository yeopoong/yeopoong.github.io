## Backtracking
> 재귀를 사용하여 모든 가능성(Decision Space)을 체크하면서 만약 조건에 맞지 않으면 그 즉시 중단하고 이전으로 돌아가서 다시 확인하는 것을 반복하면서 원하는 조건을 찾는 알고리즘
> Backtracking is an algorithm for finding all solutions by exploring all potential candidates. If the solution candidate turns to be not a solution (or at least not the last one), backtracking algorithm discards it by making some changes on the previous step, i.e. backtracks and then try again.
