## Tree
> any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

1. level
2. diameter: longest path between any two nodes in the tree. 
3. height: The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
4. width: The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes)
5. path: A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them.
6. A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Tree Traversal: 항상 루트가 기준이다.
- preorder traversal: DFS, 트리를 복사할 때 사용, 자식 노드보다 부모 노드가 먼저 생성되어야 하기 때문
- inorder traversal: BST에서 오름차순 또는 내림차순으로 값을 가져올 때 사용
- postorder traversal: 트리를 삭제할 때 사용, 부모 노드를 삭제하기 전에 자식 노드를 먼저 삭제해야 하기 때문
